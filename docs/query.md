# Querying

Typing `query` (after a database is selected) opens the **query panel**: run SQL
against the session's selected database, page through results, save/load reusable
queries, and export the current page as CSV. Before a database is selected,
`query` shows the hint `Select a database first.`

## Panel

```

In query mode the command **prompt** moves onto the panel's top row, next to the
predefined-query controls, to save vertical space.

- **SQL textarea** — the query to run. **Min / S / M / L / XL** change its height;
  **Min** collapses it to maximize room for results.
- **Execute** — runs the query at the current offset.
- **Fields** — introspects the query's output columns (see
  [Fields, selection & ordering](#fields-selection--ordering)).
- **Limit / Offset** — page size and starting row (defaults `100` / `0`).
- **Previous / Next** — step the offset by ±limit and re-run. Previous is
  disabled at offset `0`. There is no total-row count, so Next can page past the
  last row into an empty result.
- **Download CSV** — downloads the **current page** as `query.csv`, always with
  **all** columns (the field selection below is view-only).
- **Results table** — the rows for the current page, in a scrollable table.

## Fields, selection & ordering

**Fields** describes the current query's output columns (names and ClickHouse
types) without scanning data (ClickHouse `DESCRIBE (<query>)`), and populates two
pickers from that list:

- **Select fields** — a toggle per column for what the results table shows.
  **Client-side and immediate**: toggling shows/hides the column with no re-query,
  and **Download CSV** ignores it (CSV always exports every column). **Select all**
  / **Clear all** flip every toggle. New columns from a query edited since the last
  **Fields** call always show, so a stale list can't blank the table.
- **Order by** — pick one or more columns, each **ASC** (default) or **DESC**.
  **Server-side**, so it takes effect only on a re-run: **Execute** / **Previous** /
  **Next**, **Download CSV**, or the order-by section's **Run** button (re-runs the
  whole query like Execute, applying the current limit/offset). Column names are
  backtick-quoted and directions whitelisted, so the picker can't inject SQL.

Editing the SQL doesn't auto-refresh the pickers — click **Fields** again to
re-describe.

## Pagination

The backend paginates by wrapping the query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
<your query>
) LIMIT <limit> OFFSET <offset>
```

So pages are stable only if the query defines its own order — include an
`ORDER BY` for predictable `Previous`/`Next` boundaries.

## Predefined queries

Predefined queries are reusable SQL **shared globally** (not per session), keyed
by **connection type** (e.g. `clickhouse`), stored in the `predefined_queries`
SQLite table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE predefined_queries (
  id         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  query_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  type       TEXT NOT NULL,   -- connection type (clickhouse, …)
  query      TEXT NOT NULL,
  cell_view  TEXT,            -- raw YAML; per-column render config + params (see below)
  UNIQUE (type, query_name)
);
```

- The **selector** lists saved queries for the active connection's type; choosing
  one loads its SQL into the textarea and makes it the active name. Its **+ New
  name…** item prompts for a fresh name (no separate name field).
- **Save** stores the textarea's SQL (and the `cell_view` YAML) under the
  **currently selected name** and refreshes the selector. Saving an existing name
  **upserts** (overwrites) it.

Renaming and deleting predefined queries are not yet supported — see
[future.md](./future.md).

## Cell views

Each predefined query can carry a **`cell_view`** map controlling how result
cells render. Author it as YAML in the **"Cell view"** modal (toolbar button just
before the **Min** toggle), stored as raw text on the query. The modal's **Save**
persists and closes; **Cancel** or the backdrop discards. Map keys are column
names; each entry has a `type` and a `value` template. Two placeholders are
substituted from the row being rendered:

- **`{cell}`** — this column's own raw value.
- **`{row.<column>}`** — the value of another column in the **same row** (e.g.
  `{row.name}` yields that row's `name` value). An unknown column name is left
  in place untouched.

```yaml
cve_id:
  type: link
  value: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/{cell}
severity:
  type: custom
  value: <strong>{cell}</strong>
name:
  type: link
  value: https://example.com/items/{row.id}
```

Supported types:

- **`link`** — render the cell as `<a href target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{cell}</a>`. `{cell}` and any `{row.<column>}` are URL-encoded into the href; the resolved scheme must be `http`/`https` (anything else falls back to plain text).
- **`custom`** — render the `value` HTML verbatim with `{cell}` and any `{row.<column>}` substituted in. Substituted values are HTML-escaped (so DB content can't break out), but the template HTML is **trusted** and is not sanitized. **Anyone who can save a predefined query can inject markup/script that runs in every viewer's browser**, because predefined queries are shared globally with no auth.

Substitution is a single pass, so a cell value that itself looks like a
placeholder is rendered as literal (escaped) text rather than re-resolved
against the row.

Both wrappers (the `<a>` for `link`, the `<span>` for `custom`) carry
`data-testid="cell-<columnName>"`, so e2e tests can target rendered cells without
baking testids into the YAML.

Rendering uses the **saved** `cell_view` of the **currently selected** predefined
query — editor edits take effect only after **Save** (which re-fetches the list).
Ad-hoc SQL with no selected query renders plain, as does a broken (unparseable or
unrecognized-shape) `cell_view`.

Every write path — save, remote push, YAML import, git restore — **validates**
`cell_view` against this contract and rejects violations
(`invalid cell_view: …`). Reads stay lenient: rows stored before validation
existed still render, with broken entries falling back to plain text.

### Pushed cell views (MCP / remote)

A remote push (the `push_query` MCP tool, or `POST /api/remote/push`) may carry a
`cell_view` field — the same raw YAML — that styles **that pushed result only**.
It's a per-push override, not persisted: it wins over the selected query's saved
`cell_view` for rendering and is dropped on the next manual **Execute** or when a
query is picked from the dropdown. This lets an agent push a query *and* its
render rules in one call (e.g. show a `source` column as a custom HTML token)
without saving a predefined query.

## Default views for complex types

Cells whose value is a collection — a ClickHouse **`Array`**, **`Map`**, or
**`Tuple`**, or any JSON array/object another driver returns — get a built-in
**default view** with no `cell_view` authored: instead of the serialized text
(`["a","b"]`, `{"x":1}`) the cell renders a **plain vertical list**. When a
collection has more than 3 items the cell starts **collapsed**, showing the
first 3 with a `… (+N more)` expander; expanding reveals the rest plus a
`▾ collapse` control.

- **Array** — one element per line.
- **Map** — one `key → value` per line.
- **Tuple** — one `name: value` per line for a **named tuple**
  (`Tuple(id Int32, name String)` → `id: 1`); unnamed tuples use the positional
  index (`0:`, `1:`).
- **`Array(Tuple(...))`** — a list of tuples, **one tuple per line**
  (`id: 1, name: a`), so a list of records stays scannable.
- **`Array(Map(...))`** — a list of maps, **one map per line**
  (`x → 1, y → 2`). The outer array collapses to the first 3 elements.
- Nesting beyond those two cases (e.g. `Array(Array(...))`, a complex `Tuple`
  field) renders that nested piece as **JSON text**.

Values arrive structured (see [Results & CSV](#results--csv)); the column type
from the result's own metadata only decides map (`→`) versus tuple (`:`)
labelling. An explicit `cell_view` entry for a column **takes precedence** over
its default view (and is the way to opt out). Default views apply to the
on-screen table only — **Download CSV** keeps the database's own serialized
value.

## Query parameters

A predefined query can declare **dropdown selectors** whose chosen value is
substituted into the SQL. They live in a reserved **`params:`** key inside the
`cell_view` YAML (so `params` is never treated as a column-render rule). Each entry
has a `name` and a list of `options`:

```yaml
params:
  - name: source
    options: [a, b, c]
```

With the query:

```sql
select * from events where source = {source}
```

a labelled dropdown appears above the SQL textarea, one per param, populated with
the declared options. The placeholder **`{source}`** is replaced with the selected
value as a **quoted SQL string** (`source = 'b'`), with embedded single quotes
doubled — write the placeholder where a value goes, no quotes of your own. A
`{name}` with no matching param is left untouched; a param whose `{name}` never
appears in the query is harmless.

**Changing a dropdown re-runs the query immediately** (resetting to offset 0).
Substitution applies everywhere the query runs — **Execute**, **Previous** /
**Next**, **Fields** (`DESCRIBE`), and **Download CSV**. The first option is the
default.

## Options from a query (`options_sql`)

Instead of a static `options` list, a param can derive its choices from a query:

```yaml
params:
  - name: host
    options_sql: SELECT DISTINCT host FROM system.clusters ORDER BY host
```

The **first column of every row** becomes an option, in the query's own order
(use `DISTINCT` / `ORDER BY` yourself — results are not de-duplicated or sorted).
The query runs once against the current connection when the predefined query
loads, and results are cached for the session. The first row is the default.

`options` and `options_sql` are **mutually exclusive** — declaring both is
rejected at save time (and the client parse drops such an entry from
pre-validation rows). If the `options_sql` query **fails or returns no rows**, the param has
nothing to choose from, so the main query is **blocked** (run controls disabled)
and the error banner names the param.

Because values are constrained to the declared options (or the `options_sql` rows)
and quoted/escaped on substitution, params stay within the existing trust model
(the SQL textarea is already sent to the backend as-is). A broken or absent
`params:` block renders no dropdowns.

## Results & CSV

Results come back as `{meta: [{name, type}], data: [[…]]}` — ClickHouse's
`JSONCompact` shape, which the other drivers reproduce from their native rows —
and render as an HTML table, scrolling within the panel (wide results scroll
horizontally). Values are JSON as the database emitted them; 64-bit integers and
decimals are quoted as strings so nothing rounds in the browser, and arrays,
maps, and tuples arrive as JSON arrays and objects (named tuples as objects).
**Download CSV** re-runs the current page as `CSVWithNames` and saves
`query.csv` — current page only, always every column regardless of the **Select
fields** view.

## Co-edit & edit lock

An agent (via the `push_query` MCP tool) and a human can share a live session
without clobbering each other, arbitrated by a **server-side edit lock** on the
session (owner: none / human / agent, held in memory).

- **Human** acquires the lock on **focus** of any editable item in the query
  panel and releases it on **blur** (a ~10s heartbeat refreshes a 30s TTL, so a
  frozen tab can't hold it forever; a closed tab drops it immediately).
- **Agent** pushes are atomic: a push checks the lock and, if a human holds it,
  is rejected with `blocked, user editing` (the agent backs off and retries).
- A push is validated first: malformed `order_by`/`fields` are rejected with
  `invalid …` and nothing is delivered. `cell_view` stays lenient.
- When an agent push lands, the browser shows a brief **"Agent updated the
  query"** toast so the human notices the panel changed.
- **Save persists presentation:** the human's Save now stores `order_by` and the
  selected `fields` alongside `cell_view`, so reloading a predefined query
  restores its full presentation. Pushes never persist — only the human's Save
  writes to the DB.

The lock and channels live in one process's memory (like the SSE relay), so this
assumes a single backend process; multi-worker deployments would need a shared
backplane.

Queries run over the ClickHouse HTTP interface (HTTP Basic auth, 5s timeout),
scoped to the session's selected database.
