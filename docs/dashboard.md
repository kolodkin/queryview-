# Dashboards (agent-authored, pushed to a live session)

A **dashboard** is an HTML layout plus a set of named SQL queries. An AI agent
authors one and pushes it into a live, armed QueryView browser session over MCP;
it is also persisted so it can be reopened later by name.

Responsibilities mirror the [remote-control](./remote.md) layer: the agent never
receives query results back. The **browser** (trusted code with a session) runs
the queries against a named connection and feeds the results into the
agent-authored HTML, which renders inside an isolated iframe.

## The page (`/dashboard`)

`/dashboard` is the second top-level page (the first is the query workflow at
`/queries`; see [queryview.md](./queryview.md)). It has:

- a **dropdown** of saved dashboards — selecting one sets `?name=<name>`, so the
  URL is shareable and the back button works;
- a **sandboxed iframe** that renders the selected dashboard.

Open it from the prompt with `dashboard` (just the dropdown) or `dashboard
<name>` (jump straight to one), from the corner nav, or by URL. Reopening
re-fetches the dashboard and re-runs its queries, so a reloaded or shared link
always shows live data.

## The `push_dashboard` MCP tool

The FastMCP server at `/mcp` (see [remote.md](./remote.md) for arming and the
session id) exposes:

- `push_dashboard(session_id, name, connection, html, queries)` — push the
  dashboard **draft** to the browser identified by `session_id`, which navigates
  to `/dashboard?name=<name>` and renders it. It does **not** persist — only the
  user's **Save** button in the dashboard view writes it to the store (mirrors
  `push_query`). Returns `{ok, pushed, message}`; an unknown/disarmed
  `session_id` reports `pushed:false`.

`session_id` and `connection` are distinct: `session_id` is the live browser to
push the preview to; `connection` is the saved [connection](./connect.md) the
queries run against (by name — a dashboard is self-contained and portable). Its
**stored database** is used, so select a database for that connection first, or
fully-qualify table names as `db.table`.

The REST mirror `POST /api/dashboards` takes the same fields (plus optional
`session_id`) and drives the same persist-and-push path (used by the e2e suite).
See [api.md](./api.md) for the full endpoint list.

## The `window.queries` contract for HTML authors

Before the dashboard HTML runs, the page injects the results as a `window.queries`
global — a **column-oriented** map:

```js
window.queries = {
  <query_name>: { <column_name>: [values, …] },
  …
}
```

So for a query named `sales` selecting a `revenue` column,
`window.queries.sales.revenue` is that column's values. Column order is preserved.
Values are typed as the driver returns them: numbers are numbers, 64-bit
integers and decimals are strings (so nothing rounds), and arrays, maps, and
tuples are JSON arrays and objects.
Load any chart library from a CDN inside the HTML. A minimal dashboard:

```html
<canvas id="c"></canvas>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
<script>
  const { month, revenue } = window.queries.sales
  new Chart(document.getElementById('c'), {
    type: 'bar',
    data: { labels: month, datasets: [{ label: 'Revenue', data: revenue.map(Number) }] },
  })
</script>
```

## Running the queries: `/api/runqueries`

The browser POSTs `{connection, queries}` to `/api/runqueries`, which runs each
query against the connection's stored database (wrapped in a paginated subselect
capped at 1000 rows) and returns column-oriented results.

It is **fail-fast**: if any query fails, the connection is unknown, or it has no
selected database, the whole request returns an HTTP error and the page shows a
dashboard-level error banner instead of partial panels. On success every named
query is present in `window.queries`. A failing query's message is prefixed with
its panel name (e.g. `churn: Unknown table …`) so it's clear which one to fix.

## Isolation & security

The HTML renders in `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts" srcdoc=…>` **without**
`allow-same-origin`, giving it an opaque origin: it can run JS and load CDN
assets but cannot read the app's cookies, `localStorage`, or call `/api/*` with
credentials. All data reaches it only through the injected `window.queries`,
whose JSON has `<` escaped so result data containing `</script>` can't break out
of the prologue.

Like the rest of the app (and [predefined queries](./query.md)), persisted
dashboards are **global**, shared via SQLite, and keyed by name. The agent HTML
is untrusted and confined to the sandbox; it never sees connection secrets or
the session cookie.
