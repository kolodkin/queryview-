"""The MCP mount's slashless path.

The FastMCP app is mounted at `/mcp` with its own path set to `/`, so the
canonical endpoint is `/mcp/`. Starlette would normally redirect `/mcp` there,
but the SPA catch-all (`@app.get("/{full_path:path}")`) matches the slashless
path on GET only, which Starlette scores as a partial match — that suppresses
the redirect and answers `405 allow: GET` instead, pointing a client at a path
the MCP server never serves. These tests pin the redirect so the catch-all
can't swallow it again.
